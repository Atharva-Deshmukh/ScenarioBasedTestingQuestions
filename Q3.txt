How will you overcome the challenge of having limited/inaccurate documentation for testing?
- A software is never created without any requirement, there may be some requirements that are either not properly documented or there is less documentation.
  So, I will try to find out if there are any available related documentations.
- Talk to Subject Matter Experts, POs, Team members, architects..
- Document high level functionalities based on discussions with above.
- I will Apply exploratory testing and then document the test cases on the go.
