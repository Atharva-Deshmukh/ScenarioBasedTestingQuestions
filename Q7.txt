If the software is currently in production and one of the code module is modified. 
Will you retest the whole application or just test the funcionality associated with 
that module?
- Ask the interviewer the level impact and importance of this failing module
- Then only we can decide how much testing we need to do.

- If this is an independent module with no impact on other modules, then I will do 
   regression test on this module only.
  
- If this module is some core module, which can impact several other modules,
   then regression testing must be done for this modules as well as other impacted ones.
   
                       module 2
                         ^
                         |
         module 4 ---> module 1 <--- module 3
		                 |
					   module 5

- Connect with developers to know the impact and connection of the changed module with other modules and plan the testing accordingly.
