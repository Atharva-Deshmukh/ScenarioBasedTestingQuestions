What is your salary expectation?

Tip 1: Be flexible if providing expectation. (ONLY WHEN u know exact salary range)

(Provided, you have already researched salary range say 15-20 lpa, start with the higher one, 20 lpa, this gives HR a perspective that u already know the range and u aim for higher part of that range) Based on my experience, skillset and market research, I would expect to earn <Salary figure> (Mention the higher range of salary). However, salary is not a constraint for this role and your company. I am flexible and open for negotiation.

Here, you have a chance of higher negotiation.

Tip 2: Ask recruiter about typical salary for that role. (Only when u are blank about the range)

That's a good question. It would be really helpful to me if you could share what a person with my skillset and qualifications typically earns in this role with your organization.
