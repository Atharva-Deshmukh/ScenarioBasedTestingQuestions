How will you communicate with different teams? With other team members?

With team members:
- As soon as I join the organisation, I will introduce myself to all the immediate team members to build rapport (pronounced as rappo) with them.
- I will also try to personally connect with the team members face to face and understand what everyone is working on.

With different teams:
- The members from different teams will be having their own prorities and hence I will be trying to schedule a time slot from their calendar.
- I will go ahead and schedule a meeting on teams or if possible, face to face.
- I will take official route rather than pinging for help unless I build proper rapport.
