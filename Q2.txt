How will you approach testing a user story in agile project?
- Understand the story by reading Acceptance Criteria and the test design if there is any.
- Make sure every detail of the user story is clear to me. Connect with stakeholders for this.
- Define high level test scenarios.
- Cover the impact areas to other existing features.
- Priority will be what parts of the story are in the scope of the current sprint. Rest will be planned later.
- Elaborate the high level test cases into test scenarios using BDD syntax.
