If you get extra task by manager and you don't have enough time to complete it, how will you manage it?
- You are being checked whether u can stretch working hours if there is need.
- Start like this: I have been assigned this kind of extra work like last moment production issues and pipeline failures which were of higher priority than the work I was currently doing.
- When I will be getting assigned this extra task by my manager, I will ask him to clarify in the same meeting about the priority of this task so that I can plan accordigly.
- There could be a possiblity that I may not be able to finish this in the regular working time since it was assigned at last moment, I will be flexible enough to stretch some hours to finish this priority task.
