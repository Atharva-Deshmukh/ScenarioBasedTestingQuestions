Testing Pagination in Postman
- The query parameters like limit and offset for pagination do not work by default for every API. 
  They must be explicitly implemented by backend developers as part of the API logic. 
  
- If the backend does not implement pagination:

  The API will ignore the limit and offset parameters.
  The response might return all available data, leading to 
  large payloads and potential performance issues.

- query parameters used = offset and limit
- offset: if offset = 2, give response from 3rd to end
- limit: if limit = 4, give 4 responses only

- Verify in the metadata (response) the link for next page and previous page.
