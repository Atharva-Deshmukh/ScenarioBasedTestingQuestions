Where do you see yourself in five years?
- Answer should align with this role like growing deep in this role, being in the same company like seeking more senior role in the same organisation.

- In five years, I see myself growing into a leadership role such as a Senior SDET, Lead SDET, or even a Test Architect within this organization. My goal is to not only deepen my expertise in test automation but also contribute to shaping the testing strategies and mentoring junior team members.

In the short term, I am enthusiastic about honing my skills in advanced test automation frameworks, exploring new tools like Playwright, and expanding my knowledge of continuous integration pipelines and performance testing. I also aim to dive deeper into areas like API testing, security testing, and cloud-based testing.

This role excites me because it aligns with my aspirations to grow technically and professionally while making a meaningful impact.
